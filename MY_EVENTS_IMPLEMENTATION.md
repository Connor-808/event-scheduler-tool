# My Events Page Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a "My Events" page where users can view all the polls/events they've created and organized.

## Components Created

### 1. API Route (`app/api/my-events/route.ts`)
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/my-events?cookieId={cookieId}`

Fetches all events where the user is the organizer:
- ✅ Queries `user_cookies` table for `is_organizer = true`
- ✅ Returns event details with enriched statistics
- ✅ Includes participant count, vote count, time slot count
- ✅ Sorted by creation date (newest first)
- ✅ Handles empty state gracefully

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "event_id": "brave-blue-elephant",
      "title": "Team Lunch",
      "location": "Coffee Shop",
      "status": "active",
      "created_at": "2025-10-28T...",
      "participant_count": 5,
      "vote_count": 3,

```

## Database Queries

### Get User's Organized Events
```sql
SELECT event_id 
FROM user_cookies 
WHERE cookie_id = ? 
AND is_organizer = true
```

### Get Event Statistics
For each event:
- Participant count: `COUNT(*) FROM user_cookies WHERE event_id = ?`
- Vote count: `COUNT(DISTINCT cookie_id) FROM votes WHERE event_id = ?`
- Time slot count: `COUNT(*) FROM time_slots WHERE event_id = ?`

## Design Features

### Status Badges
- **Active** (Green): Event is open for voting
- **Locked** (Blue): Time has been finalized
- **Cancelled** (Red): Event was cancelled

### Statistics Icons
- 👥 Participants - Shows total event participants
- ✓ Voted - Shows unique voters count
- 🕐 Time Options - Shows number of time slots

### Interactions
